- Fixes for Obsidian integration in Safari (thanks @aancw !)
- Keep a few more HTML tags that have no markdown equivalent (`u`, `ins`, `del`, `small`, `big`) (thanks @mnaoumov !)

- Fixed saving for options when imported from file (and show a little 'saved' indicator)

- Select multiple tabs (hold crtl/cmd) then copy all tab urls as a markdown link list via keyboard shortcut or context menu (thanks @romanPrignon !)

## 3.2.0

- Updated dependencies

## 3.1.0
- Firefox for Android (nightly) support
- Updated Readability and Turndown
- Added GitHub-flavoured Markdown (GFM) plugin to Turndown (adds some mardown table support)
- Added support for MathJax -> LaTeX (thanks @LeLocTai)
- Disallow slashes in title text replacements
- Suport for Open Graph meta tags as variables (which use `property` instead of `key`)
- Fixed an issue with regex characters like `|` in date formats
- Resolved an extra slash in file name causing images to fail to download in chromium browsers
- Added some support to parse pre elements as code blocks (supports syntax highlighting on GitHub, but not much else yet)
- Added option to enable or disable the context menus
- Added some extra keyboard shortcuts. These can be customised, depending on your browser
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> opens the popup (as it has in previous versions)
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> downloads the current tab as markdown, bypassing the popup
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies the current tab as markdown to the clipboard, bypassing the popup
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> copies the current tabs URL as a markdown link to the clipboard
- Added support for template variables having different casing using `:` followed by the casing type. For example, for an article titled "Different Types of Casing":
    - `{pageTitle:pascal}` — "DifferentTypesOfCasing"
    - `{pageTitle:camel}` — "differentTypesOfCasing"
    - `{pageTitle:kebab}` — "different-types-of-casing"
    - `{pageTitle:snake` — "different_types_of_casing"
- Added support for rending italics in double underscores (`__`). This isn't valid MarkDown (will output as __bold__), but it's useful for people copying to Roam
- Support image download as base64 embedded urls, directly in the markdown file
- Added some extra variables related to the url beyond the existing `{baseURI}`:
    - `{origin}` - The origin of the URL, that is its scheme, its domain and its port
    - `{host}` - The domain (that is the _hostname_) followed by (if a port was specified) a `:` and the _port_ of the URL.
    - `{hostname}` - The domain of the URL.
    - `{port}` - The port number of the URL.
    - `{protocol}` - The protocol scheme of the URL, including the final `':'`.
    - `{pathname}` - An initial `'/'` followed by the path of the URL, not including the query string or fragment.
    - `{search}` - The URL's parameter string; if any parameters are provided, this string includes all of them, beginning with the leading `?` character.
