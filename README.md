# MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/deathau/markdownload?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/releases/latest)

This is an extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file. Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.

To use this add-on, simply click the add-on icon while you are browsing the page you want to save offline. A popup will show the rendered markdown so you can make minor edits or copy the text, or you can click the download button to download an .md file.  
Selecting text will allow you to download just the selected text

## Pricing
This is an open-source extension I made *for fun*. It's intention is to be completely free.
It's free on Firefox, Edge and Chrome (and other Chromium browsers),
but unfortunately for Safari there is a yearly developer fee, so I've decided to
charge a small price for the Safari version to help cover that cost.
Alternately, you can become a GitHub Sponsor for as little as $2 per month and
you can request a key for the Safari version.
Also, even if you're using the free version and you absolutely *have* to
send me money because you like it that much, feel free to throw some coins
in my hat via the following:

# Version History
## 3.1.0
- Updated Readability and Turndown
- Added GitHub-flavoured Markdown (GFM) plugin to Turndown (adds some mardown table support)
- Added support for MathJax -> LaTeX (thanks @LeLocTai)
- Disallow slashes in title text replacements
- Suport for Open Graph meta tags as variables (which use `property` instead of `key`)
- Fixed an issue with regex characters like `|` in date formats
- Resolved an extra slash in file name causing images to fail to download in chromium browsers
- Added some support to parse pre elements as code blocks (supports syntax highlighting on GitHub, but not much else yet)
- Added option to enable or disable the context menus
- Added some extra keyboard shortcuts. These can be customised, depending on your browser
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> opens the popup (as it has in previous versions)
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> downloads the current tab as markdown, bypassing the popup
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> copies the current tab as markdown to the clipboard, bypassing the popup
    - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> copies the current tabs URL as a markdown link to the clipboard
- Added support for template variables having different casing using `:` followed by the casing type. For example, for an article titled "Different Types of Casing":
    - `{pageTitle:pascal}` â€” "DifferentTypesOfCasing"
    - `{pageTitle:camel}` â€” "differentTypesOfCasing"
    - `{pageTitle:kebab}` â€” "different-types-of-casing"
    - `{pageTitle:snake` â€” "different_types_of_casing"
- Added support for rending italics in double underscores (`__`). This isn't valid MarkDown (will output as __bold__), but it's useful for people copying to Roam
- Support image download as base64 embedded urls, directly in the markdown file
- Added some extra variables related to the url beyond the existing `{baseURI}`:
    - `{origin}` - The origin of the URL, that is its scheme, its domain and its port
    - `{host}` - The domain (that is the _hostname_) followed by (if a port was specified) a `:` and the _port_ of the URL.
    - `{hostname}` - The domain of the URL.
    - `{port}` - The port number of the URL.
    - `{protocol}` - The protocol scheme of the URL, including the final `':'`.
    - `{pathname}` - An initial `'/'` followed by the path of the URL, not including the query string or fragment.
    - `{search}` - The URL's parameter string; if any parameters are provided, this string includes all of them, beginning with the leading `?` character.

- Added a new `{pageTitle}` option for template replacement (there are many websites where the `{title}` and `{pageTitle}` actually differ)

- Added some focus styling so you can tell what is focused
